# MasterPageProject
This is my first master page project in which 
I have used asp.net, C#, and SQL Server etc. in this project.
I have performed CRUD operations 
like insert data into SQL Server database, delete record, update record etc.
Exept this you can see in this project I have used
the master page, header-footer page and 
I have added a searching text box to search record from the database.

Note: Create database before runing this program by using database script file.
